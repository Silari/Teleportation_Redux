message-no-sending-beacons-or-equipment=You must stand on a Teleporter Beacon or have a Personal Teleporter equipped to teleport.
message-sender-and-destination-are-same=You are already at this Beacon's location.
message-sitting-in-vehicle=You cannot teleport when inside a vehicle unless that vehicle has teleportation equipment installed.
message-sending-beacon-no-energy=This Teleporter Beacon does not have enough energy (__1__% of needed).
message-no-power-pt=Your Personal Teleporter does not have enough energy (__1__% of needed).
message-no-power-tb=The destination Teleporter Beacon does not have enough energy (__1__% of needed).
message-no-destination=No destination beacon with enough energy could be found.
message-no-equipment=You are not equipped with a Personal Teleporter.
message-invalid-destination=No valid position for teleport near selected destination.
message-too-frequent-use-portal=You can only use the Jump Targeter once per __1__ sec.
message-jump-to-closest-beacon-failure=You couldn't jump...
message-no-valid-beacon=You need to place a beacon to jump to.

[mod-setting-description]
Teleportation-all-beacons-for-all=Everyone is allowed to use any beacon, regardless of owning force.
Teleportation-telelogistics-enabled=Enables Telelogistics research, which allows creation of teleprovider chests, which can be linked to a beacon to send items to it. Items can be pulled from a beacon via inserters or loaders.
Teleportation-straight-jump-ignores-collisions=You can jump anywhere, even into water, buildings, or other objects.\nNOTE: You can get stuck or die from an invalid destination point!
Teleportation-page-size=Maximum amount of rows shown on each page of the beacons list. If too many are on a page to fit the screen, the GUI will have a scrollbar.
Teleportation-Dynamic-Loop=Dynamically adjusts the speed of the Teleprovider LUA code so teleproviders send items at least once per second. If disabled, they will use the pre 1.1.3 method of one teleprovider per tick. The new method may perform slowly if there are many teleproviders, but the old method may take many seconds between updates.
Teleportation-equip-portal=Cost in kJ for using the jump targeter per meter distance travelled.
Teleportation-equip-beacon=Energy cost for equipment to jump to a beacon.
Teleportation-beacon-usage=Cost for a beacon to be a teleport origin or destination.
Teleportation-beacon-storage=Maximum energy storage of a beacon. The default is just enough for a vanilla spidertron to make use of beacons.
Teleportation-beacon-charge=Charge rate of beacons. This effects how often they can be continously used.

[item-name]
teleportation-equipment=Personal Teleporter
teleportation-portal=Jump Targeter
teleportation-targeter=Jump Targeter

[item-description]
teleportation-equipment=Allows you to teleport to any Teleporter Beacon or jump to any position in sight. Teleporting to a beacon requires __1__. Teleporting elsewhere requires __2__ per meter. Teleporting in a vehicle requires the vehicle to have __ITEM__teleportation-equipment__ equipment installed in the vehicle and costs more power.
teleportation-portal=Used to target the position you want to jump to. Uses energy from an equipped Personal Teleporter. The required energy is directly proportional to jump distance. 
teleportation-targeter=Used to target the position you want to jump to. Uses energy from an equipped Personal Teleporter. The required energy is directly proportional to jump distance.

[entity-description]
teleportation-beacon=Sender and receiver in your teleporter network. If charged, can teleport you to another charged beacon. Holds __1__ and charges at __2__. Requires __3__ to send or receive a player. Teleporting in a vehicle requires the vehicle to have "__ITEM__teleportation-equipment__" equipment installed in the vehicle and costs more power.
teleportation-teleprovider=Sends items to the beacon it's linked to. Build it, then press "__CONTROL__teleportation-hotkey-adjust-teleprovider__" while the chest is selected to open the linking menu.

teleportation-tech=Unlocks Teleporter Beacons that allow you to teleport between them.
teleportation-tech-adv=Unlocks Personal Teleporter equipment that allows you to teleport to any Teleporter Beacon from anywhere, and a Jump Targeter to jump to any position in sight.
teleportation-telelogistics=Allows you to create Teleproviders, that can send items to the beacon they're linked to.
teleportation-tech-storage=Increases the maximum energy storage of a teleporter beacon by 25% each level.
