message-no-sending-beacons-or-equipment=You must stand on a Teleporter Beacon or have a Personal Teleporter equipped to teleport.
message-sender-and-destination-are-same=You are already at this Beacon's location.
message-sitting-in-vehicle=You cannot teleport when inside a vehicle unless that vehicle has teleportation equipment installed.

[mod-setting-description]
Teleportation-all-beacons-for-all=Everyone is allowed to use any beacon, regardless of owning force.
Teleportation-telelogistics-enabled=Enables Telelogistics research, which allows creation of teleprovider chests, which can be linked to a beacon to send items to it. Items can be pulled from a beacon via inserters or loaders.
Teleportation-straight-jump-ignores-collisions=You can jump anywhere, even into water, buildings, or other objects.\nNOTE: You can get stuck or die from an invalid destination point!
Teleportation-page-size=Maximum amount of rows shown on each page of the beacons list. If too many are on a page to fit the screen, the GUI will have a scrollbar.
Teleportation-Dynamic-Loop=Dynamically adjusts the speed of the Teleprovider LUA code so teleproviders send items at least once per second. If disabled, they will use the pre 1.1.3 method of one teleprovider per tick. The new method may perform slowly if there are many teleproviders, but the old method may take many seconds between updates.

[item-description]
teleportation-equipment=Allows you to teleport to any Teleporter Beacon or jump to any position in sight. Teleporting to a beacon requires 50MJ. Teleporting elsewhere requires 250kJ per meter. Teleporting in a vehicle requires the vehicle to have __ITEM__teleportation-equipment__ equipment installed in the vehicle and costs more power.
teleportation-portal=Used to target the position you want to jump to. Uses energy from an equipped Personal Teleporter. The required energy is directly proportional to jump distance. 
teleportation-targeter=Used to target the position you want to jump to. Uses energy from an equipped Personal Teleporter. The required energy is directly proportional to jump distance.

[entity-description]
teleportation-beacon=Sender and receiver in your teleporter network. If charged, can teleport you to another charged beacon. Holds 300MJ and charges at 5MW. Requires 100MJ to send or receive a player. Teleporting in a vehicle requires the vehicle to have "__ITEM__teleportation-equipment__" equipment installed in the vehicle and costs more power.
teleportation-teleprovider=Sends items to the beacon it's linked to. Build it, then press "__CONTROL__teleportation-hotkey-adjust-teleprovider__" while the chest is selected to open the linking menu.
