---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.6
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed wrong error given when wearing armor with an equipment grid and attempting to teleport using the beacon list while inside a vehicle while not near a beacon. Presence of a vehicle is now checked first and overrides other possible errors.
    - Recipe for jump targeter wasn't removed from Advanced Teleportation as it should have been since 1.1.3. The item will continue to exist for legacy reasons but the shortcut version should be used instead.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.5
  Bugfixes:
    - Added check for entity validity in Teleportation_CountBeacons function to prevent a crash. Some other functions had validity checks added JIC.
    - Added script_raise_delete event to the list of subscribed events so the mod can remove beacons that were deleted by a script to prevent the above issue in cases where the event was raised.
    - Teleportation_Migrate function that is run when configuration changes has been updated to actually run, and to clean up the leftover map marker and hidden accumulator if the beacon is no longer valid. Altogether these three should help keep the list clean and prevent future issues.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.4
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed Telelogistics error on startup.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.3
  Changes:
    - The Jump Targeter is now a shortcut on the hotbar as well as a Ctrl+J shortcut. The item version is deprecated but still present for now.
    - Added new setting - "Dynamic Teleprovider Loop". This controls how fast the mod processes Teleproviders. Under the old method, one teleprovider is processed per tick, leading to fluctuating throughput depending on how many providers exist. New method iterates over each provider once per second, spread throughout the second.
      - In summary, new method provides consistent throughput for each provider, but may perform noticeably slower if you have hundred/thousands of them.
    - Hitting the hotkey to open the Teleprovider linking menu will now close the window if no teleprovider is highlighted, or change which teleprovider the window will setup if one is highlighted.
  Optimisations:
    - Moved initialization code out of on_tick function and into on_configuration_changed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.1.2
  Info:
    - Release for 1.1 based on 1.0.2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.2
  Bugfixes:
    - Removed some useless bits of code from places - ex. "per_user" in settings.
    - Fixed that beacon information window wouldn't update beacon name if a new beacon was selected without the window closing.
  Changes:
    - Added additional power usage information to beacon and teleporter equipment descriptions.
    - Beacon information window now includes the numerical values for current and max charge in addition to the progress bar.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.1
  Bugfixes:
    - Beacon list is resorted after a successful teleportation if it's using 'nearest to player' beacon sorting.
  Changes:
    - Telelogistics tech now requires Teleportation tech, since beacons are required to make use of it. Logistic System tech is also still required.
    - Update the error message when attempting to teleport from a beacon without enough power, and player does not have teleportation equipment.
    - Update error messages when using the Jump to Nearest Beacon command:
      - Messages are fully supressed when iterating over them
      - Specific message if there are no valid beacons.
        - For the Russian locale, this is a copy of the generic failure message since I can't translate it myself.
      - Specific message if you're already standing on the only beacon.
      - Specific message if you are not on a beacon and have no personal teleporters.
      - Specific message if your personal teleporter isn't charged enough.
  Optimisations:
    - Updated various code to streamline and optimize - removed unneeded requires, removed some bits that do nothing, and moved some checks earlier in code to save time.
  Translation:
    - Edited the en locale messages for grammer/spelling/clarification/etc.
    - Teleprovider now uses the currently assigned hotkey, rather than hardcoding the default key.
      - Russian locale needs verified that this change looks correct.
