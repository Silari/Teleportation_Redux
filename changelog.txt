Version: 1.1.2
  Info:
    - Release for 1.1 based on 1.0.2.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.2
  Bugfixes:
    - Removed some useless bits of code from places - ex. "per_user" in settings.
    - Fixed that beacon information window wouldn't update beacon name if a new beacon was selected without the window closing.
  Changes:
    - Added additional power usage information to beacon and teleporter equipment descriptions.
    - Beacon information window now includes the numerical values for current and max charge in addition to the progress bar.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.1
  Bugfixes:
    - Beacon list is resorted after a successful teleportation if it's using 'nearest to player' beacon sorting.
  Changes:
    - Telelogistics tech now requires Teleportation tech, since beacons are required to make use of it. Logistic System tech is also still required.
    - Update the error message when attempting to teleport from a beacon without enough power, and player does not have teleportation equipment.
    - Update error messages when using the Jump to Nearest Beacon command:
      - Messages are fully supressed when iterating over them
      - Specific message if there are no valid beacons.
        - For the Russian locale, this is a copy of the generic failure message since I can't translate it myself.
      - Specific message if you're already standing on the only beacon.
      - Specific message if you are not on a beacon and have no personal teleporters.
      - Specific message if your personal teleporter isn't charged enough.
  Optimisations:
    - Updated various code to streamline and optimize - removed unneeded requires, removed some bits that do nothing, and moved some checks earlier in code to save time.
  Translation:
    - Edited the en locale messages for grammer/spelling/clarification/etc.
    - Teleprovider now uses the currently assigned hotkey, rather than hardcoding the default key.
      - Russian locale needs verified that this change looks correct.
